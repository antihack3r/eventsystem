# eventsystem
An event system I made for the funny.

## Usage examples
C src/test/java/testing/Main.java for examples.

## ???
This system is extremely fast (0-1 ms latency), but for whatever reason the first class/listener to be registered on the bus takes a LONG time to register, i'm talking 90-120 ms.

## how do i use it in my progect
Download the jar from releases and [https://stackoverflow.com/a/43596431](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43596431)
